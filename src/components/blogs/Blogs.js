            <article className="dosha--body">
            Ayurveda identifies three basic types of energy or functional principles that are present in everyone and everything. This is called the Tridosha principle. When these three doshas Vata, Pitta and Kapha (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) are balanced then the body remains healthy. The principles of Ayurveda may be related to the basic biology of the body. In Ayurveda, the body, mind and consciousness work together in maintaining balance. An unbalanced state of body, mind and consciousness is called vikruti. Ayurveda brings health and keeps the doshas in balance.
