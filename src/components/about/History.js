            Seven hundred legitimate are its members. All Vaidyas are hardworking and contribute towards the upliftment of Ayurveda with dedication.
            <br/>
            Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha these four Purushartha scriptures have said. The main instrument of all this is the body. Therefore the body should be protected. For this reason, the benevolent sages like Dhanvantari Atri Bharadwaj created Ayurveda, the Upveda form of Atharvaveda, composed by Brahma ji. The sages like Charak, Sushruta, Vagbhatacharya etc. protected, promoted and raised the flag of Ayurveda in the world. Today, due to the lack of royalty, the propagation of western civilization, due to the grace of Vaidyas and lack of good teachers, we are humiliated. We need to be determined to bring this ancient knowledge in its ancient developed form. In this series, about 75 years ago, Vaidya Mandal was established in Hoshiarpur, Hoshiarpur has given Vaidya Banna Ram ji, Pt. Mast Ram ji Sastri, Vaidya Lakshman Das ji Sood, Vaidya Kedar Nath ji Bhargava to the Ayurveda world. He has contributed in his own way in the propagation of Ayurveda. Vaidya Loknathji Sood established the Vaidya Mandal and facilitated the mutual contact of Vaidyas. We have to convert the banyan tree like Vaidya Mandal propitiated by him into Akshayavat. Vaidya Ram Roop ji Shastri, Vaidya Nilambar Dutt ji Suit Vaidya Dina Nath ji, Vaidya Krishna Chand ji Bhargava, Vaidya Baldev Prasad ji Sharda, such as selfless and Ayurveda loving Vaidyas got the leadership and due to their good efforts today Dhanvantari Vaidya Mandal got their works. Trying to move forward.
